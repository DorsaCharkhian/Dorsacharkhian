                    <p class="case-study-text">Sustainability education has an impact problem: people know fashion harms the environment, but knowing doesn't change behavior. VR offered a different approach - making people feel the supply chain instead of reading about it. But "feeling" is hard to measure, and the VR team was defaulting to packing in more facts. The research had to answer: does emotion actually drive understanding better than information?</p>

                        <p class="case-study-text">This was a collaboration with the Academy of Natural Sciences. We had a short exhibition window - just a few weeks - to get visitors through the VR experience AND collect meaningful feedback. No time for lengthy studies. I had to figure out what was working while people were still walking through the door.</p>
                        <p class="case-study-text">The biggest constraint: museum visitors range from 8-year-olds who've never worn a VR headset to adults who already know everything about fast fashion. Same experience, wildly different starting points. The research had to account for that.</p>

                    <p class="case-study-text"><strong>Intercept surveys (QR-based).</strong> Quick, anonymous surveys right after visitors removed the headset. I measured recall, emotional response, and comprehension of key sustainability concepts. Over 60 responses in 4 weeks.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-text"><strong>Short interviews (5-8 minutes).</strong> I stationed myself at the exit and caught willing visitors. "What do you remember?" "How did that make you feel?" "Would you change anything about how you shop?" Open-ended, but consistent across visitors.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-text"><strong>Behavioral observation.</strong> I watched visitors during the experience - noting gasps, laughter, discomfort, headset removal. These reactions told me which moments had visceral impact.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-text"><strong>Daily synthesis.</strong> I clustered feedback each evening and shared patterns with the team before the next day's visitors arrived. This let us make adjustments mid-exhibition.</p>

                        <p class="case-study-text"><strong>Finding 1: Story beats information.</strong> Visitors remembered the cotton field scene and the water waste visualization. They forgot the statistics. The ones who felt something could explain sustainability concepts better than those who were shown data.</p>
                        <p class="case-study-text"><strong>Finding 2: Prior knowledge didn't matter as much as emotion.</strong> Sustainability experts and first-timers had nearly identical emotional responses to the immersive scenes. Emotion was a more reliable driver of engagement than knowledge level.</p>
                        <p class="case-study-text"><strong>Finding 3: Overloading information caused disengagement.</strong> Visitors who encountered dense informational sections spent less time in the experience and recalled less afterward. The correlation was clear: more facts, less retention.</p>

                    <p class="case-study-text">The team wanted to add more facts - statistics about water usage, carbon footprints, factory conditions. The research said: stop. I recommended three changes:</p>
                    <ul class="case-study-list">
                        <li><strong>Cut informational content by 50%.</strong> Remove statistics and data overlays that competed with the immersive experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extend emotional scenes.</strong> Give visitors more time in the cotton field and water waste environments - the moments with highest recall and impact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add reflection pauses.</strong> Instead of more facts, add moments of silence after emotional peaks to let the feeling settle.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="case-study-text">After these changes: engagement went up 45%, comprehension went up 50%. Feeling something is the first step to understanding it.</p>
