                    <p>
                        I'm a UX Researcher with a deliberate, reflective approach to understanding people and the systems they navigate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tend to start quietly—by observing, listening, and researching before acting. I spend time looking for patterns: how people think, where they hesitate, what feels confusing, and what repeatedly breaks down across similar roles or products. Writing, sketching, and stepping away from a problem are central to how I process complexity and arrive at clarity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work focuses on turning qualitative research into grounded insights teams can trust—especially in complex or high-stakes contexts where moving too fast can introduce risk. I help teams make more confident decisions by slowing down at the right moments, asking better questions, and testing assumptions before systems scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Much of my research has taken place in AI-powered products, accessibility-focused platforms, education, healthcare, and public-sector systems. I'm particularly drawn to environments where users are diverse, decisions carry real consequences, and thoughtful evaluation matters more than speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teaching and mentorship are a natural extension of my research practice. I enjoy helping others think more clearly about their work, reflect on their assumptions, and gain confidence in their decisions—whether through teaching at Pratt Institute, reviewing for ACM TOCHI, mentoring on ADPList, or working closely with cross-functional teams.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-belief">
                        I believe strong products aren't defined by intelligence or polish alone, but by the care taken to understand people, test ideas rigorously, and include those most affected by the systems we build.
                    </p>

                            <p>I begin by listening. Through interviews, usability testing, observation, and evaluative research, I work to understand not just what users do—but where they hesitate, pause, or lose confidence.</p>

                            <p>This is where my strongest work happens. I write, map patterns, sketch connections, and revisit insights over time—looking for what's consistent, what contradicts itself, and what truly matters.</p>
