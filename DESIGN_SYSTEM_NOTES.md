# Case Study UI Design System

I standardized the UI design system across all three case studies to ensure visual consistency and reduce cognitive load for recruiters, while keeping each project's content and narrative intact.

**Changes were limited to shared UI elements:**
- Spacing (hero, content, sections)
- Typography (section titles, body text, accent lines)
- Accent lines (Key insight / Research scope  - shared class)
- Section styling (Impact grid, Key Takeaway, figures, captions)
- Reusable CSS classes (e.g. `case-study-text-accent`, `case-study-lead-in`, `case-study-tools`)

**No project content, structure, or insights were modified.** No project-specific sections were added or removed solely for consistency.

**Goal:** A cohesive portfolio experience where each case study feels distinct in substance but consistent in presentation.
