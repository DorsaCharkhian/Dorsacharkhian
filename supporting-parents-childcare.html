                    <h2 class="case-study-section-title"><a href="#context">The Setup</a></h2>
                    <p class="case-study-text">This was a team project in grad school. We didn't ship anything - it was conceptual. But the research was real. We talked to actual parents about actual moments of panic, and what we heard changed how I think about healthcare UX.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Problem -->
                <div class="case-study-section" id="problem">
                    <h2 class="case-study-section-title"><a href="#problem">Problem</a></h2>
                    <p class="case-study-text">Parents don't trust the random health advice they find online. They're anxious, overwhelmed, and just want someone to tell them "it's fine" or "go to the doctor." But getting that reassurance is surprisingly hard.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Role & Cross-Functional Collaboration -->
                <div class="case-study-section" id="role">
                    <h2 class="case-study-section-title"><a href="#role">What I Did</a></h2>
                    <p class="case-study-text">I led the research piece: designed the interview guide, talked to parents, mapped out their journeys. Then I worked with the team to turn those messy, emotional stories into something we could actually design around.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-text">One interview stuck with me. A mom described Googling "baby rash dangerous" at 3am, getting 47 different answers, and just crying. That's not a UX problem you solve with better information architecture. That's a trust problem.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Research Methods -->
                <div class="case-study-section" id="methods">
                    <h2 class="case-study-section-title"><a href="#methods">How I Approached It</a></h2>
                    <p class="case-study-text">Semi-structured interviews, mostly. I asked parents to walk me through the last time they worried about their kid's health. Not hypotheticals - real moments. The specificity mattered.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-text">Then we mapped those stories: where did they go first? What made them trust (or distrust) what they found? Where did they give up? The patterns were surprisingly consistent.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Key Research Insight -->
                <div class="case-study-section" id="insights">
                    <h2 class="case-study-section-title"><a href="#insights">What I learned</a></h2>
                    <p class="case-study-text">Parents didn't want more information - they wanted a person. Someone who could listen, understand the context, and say "here's what I'd do." That changed our whole approach from building a content library to designing human connections.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- How Research Informed Decisions -->
                <div class="case-study-section" id="decisions">
                    <h2 class="case-study-section-title"><a href="#decisions">The Pivot</a></h2>
                    <p class="case-study-text">We started with the assumption that parents needed better information. They didn't. They needed someone to talk to.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-text">That shifted our entire approach. Instead of designing another symptom-checker or content library, we focused on services that connected parents to real people: a 24/7 hotline to nurses, mobile clinics for underserved areas, an app that prepped parents before doctor visits.</p>
                    <p class="case-study-text">None of these were revolutionary ideas. But the research gave us permission to prioritize human connection over feature lists.</p>
