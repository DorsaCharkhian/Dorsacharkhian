                    <p>
                        You have users who are struggling, dropping off, or complaining - but you're not sure why. That's where I come in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I dig into the messy details: watching how people actually use your product, listening to what frustrates them, finding the patterns you might have missed. No assumptions, no rushing to solutions. Just honest answers about what's working and what isn't.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've done this work in complex spaces - AI chatbots, healthcare systems, accessibility tools, education platforms. Places where getting it wrong costs you users, trust, or both.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also teach UX Research at Pratt Institute, review papers for ACM TOCHI, and mentor researchers on ADPList. Teaching keeps me sharp - when you explain something to others, you quickly find out what you actually know.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-belief">
                        Good products come from slowing down, asking harder questions, and actually listening to the people who use what you're building.

                            <p>Research that stays in a slide deck doesn't help anyone. You'll get findings your team can actually use to make confident decisions.</p>

                            <p>Users change. Products evolve. Good research keeps asking whether things are still working - so your product keeps getting better.</p>
