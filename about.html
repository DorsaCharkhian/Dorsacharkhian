                    <p>
                        I'm a UX Researcher. I like understanding why people get stuck, confused, or frustrated when using products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I usually start by watching and listening. Not jumping to solutions. I look for patterns: where do people hesitate? What feels confusing? What keeps breaking? Sometimes the answers come from interviews, sometimes from just observing. Often I need to step away, sketch things out, or write my way through a problem before it clicks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of my work has been in messy, complicated spaces: AI chatbots, healthcare systems, accessibility tools, education platforms. These are places where getting it wrong actually matters. I like that pressure. It keeps the work honest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also teach at Pratt Institute, review papers for ACM TOCHI, and mentor researchers on ADPList. Teaching helps me stay sharp. When you have to explain something to someone else, you realize what you actually understand and what you've been faking.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-belief">
                        I think good products come from caring enough to slow down, ask harder questions, and include the people who'll actually use what you're building.

                            <p>Interviews, usability tests, observation. I pay attention to where people pause, get confused, or give up. That's usually where the real problem is.</p>

                            <h3 class="home-featured-card-title">Make Sense of It</h3>
                            <p>I write things down, draw maps, look for patterns. What keeps coming up? What contradicts what? This part takes time, and I've learned not to rush it.</p>

                            <h3 class="home-featured-card-title">Test Before Committing</h3>
                            <p>Before anyone builds anything, I share early ideas and ask for pushback. It's easier to change a sketch than to undo a shipped feature.</p>

                            <p>Research doesn't help if it stays in a slide deck. I work with designers, engineers, and PMs to turn findings into decisions people actually trust.</p>

                            <p>Even after launch, I stay curious. Things change. Users change. Good work gets better when you keep asking if it's still working.</p>
